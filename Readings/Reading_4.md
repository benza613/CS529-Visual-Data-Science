Summary:

 - LL: In a Supervised learning approach, we train & fit a model over a dataset of "right answers". 

 - LL: In the case of housing example being a regression problem, the model learns to predict continuous values. In the case of the breast cancer example being a classification problem, the model learns by attempting to misclassify the least number of points in the data, ie. minimize training error.

 - LL: Complexity of training increases in proportion to features or characteristics available in data.

 

Discussion points:

 - Q1: For 2 features (age & tumor size) the visualization in 2D was pretty straight forward, and it is very easy to interpret for a stakeholder / patient. As the number of features grows for a model, what would be an effective way of visualizing such a solved problem that is easily interpretable? 

 - Q2: Are most real world problems easily solved (atleast for visual representation purpose) using the general learning algorithms or require ensemble algorithms to be developed and hypertuned?
