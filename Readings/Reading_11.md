**Summary:**

 - LL: The presence of machine learning in automated systems has been growing and to maximize utility that they get, users must develop trust in automated systems appropriately. If a user doesn't feel that they understand a system well it may lead to misuse or disuse

 - LL: There has been increasing amounts of studies to explain intelligent system’s behavior to non-technical users & improve human interpretability of machine learning for increasing users’ trust.

 - LL: Layout / position is a key factor in designing visualization that affects people’s perception and cognition. The authors mainly used three spatial layouts (grid, tree, and graph) to illustrate relationships between examples. 

**Discussion points:**

 - Q1: In the results section RQ2, the users reported a slightly better trust score for layouts that utilized grid explanations as compared to tree and graph explanations; a spatial layout that arguably provides lesser information than a tree or graph can?

 - Q2: what could be other applications of example-based explanations in machine learning?
