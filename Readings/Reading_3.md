Summary:

 - LL1: Human beings generally greater difficulty in comprehending luminance versus color; the author provides a compelling argument for the same "Given two patches of gray, it is easy to identify which is lighter, but given two colors, it is often difficult to draw such a distinction"

 - LL2: Artists of old have used their command of luminance & various color combinations to represent depth, motion & even illusion on a 2D canvas, in a similar manner like we come to expect nowadays from special effects in movies.

 - LL3: The neurons in the human brain can easily detect sudden visual changes, but it's not so easily when the luminance shifts gradually.
 

Discussion points:

 - Q1: I studied image processing using convolutional neural networks last semester. I wonder what role would varying strengths of illumination or luminance take in terms of performance/ effectiveness of the model.

 - Q2: In data visualization, is it a better idea to utilize different geometrical shapes or patterns, fill textures, etc rather than a common shape with a color palette of varying luminance?
