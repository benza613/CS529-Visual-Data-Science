**Summary:**

    LL: Domain characterization in scientific visualization places less emphasis on user feelings and emotions as compared to HCI & involves understanding the mathematical or computational underpinnings of the domain problem. 

    LL: 3.3.2 "The context probes capture, from an activity perspective, the validity of engaging in the project, as well as its potential impact." It was interesting to read how this component of the model can help in exploration of possibilities through brainstorming and critiquing & building rationale

    FF: 3.4.3 "users read, pay attention to, and comment on entertaining specifications. In contrast, most users do not read formal specifications."

**Discussion points:**

    Q1: 3.4.2 "Functional specifications are evolving documents, which get updated after each interview and as the project evolves." From a visual perspective, if the designers have to keep deviating away from an original/agreed-upon design, how much could this significantly impact the products' potential (positively/ negatively) given that we must pay attention to other real world constraints like development time, payroll, domain data validity?

    Q2: 4.1 This work evaluated "success" of each project in terms of novelty & the domain expertsâ€™ interest in adopting the research result as a tool. Even given the low project numbers (arguably the market for sci vis tools is much much smaller than say social media tools), could the lower success rate in the 1st 40 set be heavily affected by human bias ?
