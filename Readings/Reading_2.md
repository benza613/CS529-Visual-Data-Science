Summary:

 - LL1: Traditionally I have always related data visualization approaches to the characteristics of a dataset itself, however Tory puts forth an interesting viewpoint of approaching & classifying visualization techniques based on the characteristics of models of the data rather than on the characteristics of the data itself. She believes that these model visualization categories are less ambiguous than the previous methods and may be more effective to us. 

 - LL2: I learnt that "scientific visualization isn't necessarily   uninformative, and vice versa information visualization isn't necessarily unscientific"; meaning that these two sub-fields, traditionally considered exclusive, definitely can share some overlap in terms of concepts, algorithms or goals. Nowadays, in the era of exploding big data encompassing multiple domains, I feel that the merging of ideas and concepts in LL1 and here will become a necessity to mine meaningful trends and patterns from the data.

 - LL3: A common argument between most the panelists has been the uncertainty over whether these sub-fields should be separate or integrated and there is no consensus over any one goal or approach that can be a key unifying or divisive factor .

 

Discussion points:

 - Q1: I understand the field of infovis deals very well with high dimensional data, but how does scivis, usually associated with 2D or 3D, now handle visual mapping or structuring in big or high dim data?

 - Q2: Are there any other/ newer visualization classification schemes like the taxonomy proposed by Tory - "continuous / discrete model visualization"
