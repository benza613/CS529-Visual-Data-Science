**Summary:**

 - LL: Setting an emphasis on dealing with bugs asap is considered a good practice. The longer one waits to fix a bug, the costlier it becomes to fix it in terms of time and money.

 - LL: "A hallway usability test is where you grab the next person that passes by in the hallway and force them to try to use the code you just wrote. If you do this to five people, you will learn 95% of what there is to learn about usability problems in your code." UI & visual testing helps you quickly discover most problems people might have with your code

 - FF: TJT Pt.7 "Writing specs is like flossing: everybody agrees that itâ€™s a good thing, but nobody does it." It is super essential to develop functional specs for your project that are easily accessible and readable by people at all levels associated with the project.

**Discussion points:**

 - Q1: TJT Pt. 4 speaks about how a Bug Database should look & be addressed. While this is good practice in theory, it's been almost 22 years since this article was written. Nowadays, given intense competition and how a product's lifecycle & time-to-market is so critical, could you think of some metric to prioritize bug fixing rather than just going down a long list of bugs?

 - Q2: PFS Part 2. anyone with prior experience - Is it a better practice to write 1 spec sheet or write different versions of the same spec sheet for all types of audiences: programmers, testers, marketing, tech writers, etc ??
