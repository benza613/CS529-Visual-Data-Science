Summary:

    LL: In unsupervised learning, data is structured into clusters based on some common characteristics of each data point

    LL: Clustering & unsupervised learning algorithms are used by news aggregators & genomic studies.

    LL: In real life problems, especially with big data, we do not really have predetermined labels/categories or segments to split the data into. These kinds of data are complex enough to have characteristics over which an unsupervised learning algorithm can generate multiple clusters based on commonalities.

Discussion points:

    Q1: The cocktail party algorithm is able to detect & cluster 2 inputs(audio patterns) from 2 different sources, but theoretically what would it look/sound like if there was noise in the background (multiple audio patterns)?

    Q2: Myself I have only ever used python. Does anyone here have any actual experience with octave ? Can you compare or contrast it to python or julia?
