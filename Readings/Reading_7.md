**Summary:**

 - LL: Task transformation from domain specific languages into an abstract form allows us to easily learn similarities and differences between them even if we aren't domain experts.

 - LL: 3.4.1.3 "people with no interest in having children, who analyzed many different historical trends and posted extensively about their findings in their personal blogs, motivated by their own enjoyment rather than a pressing need". The example of the Name Voyager is an apt example of the point that the Enjoy goal is trying to portray; if a visualisation tool is enjoyable, the users can get sufficiently engaged with it over a period of time.

 - FF: "The most common use case for visualization is for the user to consume information that has already been generated as data stored in a format amenable to computation"

**Discussion points:**

 - Q1: In the 'how' part of the framework where the author discusses deriving one attribute, what could be alternate methods for deriving and filter node importance ??

 - Q2: 3.7.3 is the principle of 'Deriving many new attributes' limited to only spatial data? Because the example highlighted is not necessarily straightforward without some domain knowledge of terms - like vorticity, entropy, enthalpy, and so on
