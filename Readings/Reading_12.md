**Topic**: [Clustrophile 2: Guided Visual Clustering Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03048.pdf)

**Summary:**

 - LL: In Unsupervised learning where the classification labels are not provided, it becomes challenging to understand implicit relationships between features and cluster them without the correct parameters. Even after that happens, another important challenge is about how to efficiently navigate this large cluster space rapidly.

 - LL: Clustrophile 2 allows for rapid exploratory data analysis by enabling the users to interactively play about with various cluster parameters allowing for easier interpretation of clusters, and helps quickly reason about differences between clusterings.

 - LL: Inorder to evaluate the “goodness” of a clustering, Clustrophile uses decision rules and automated cluster descriptions to foster interpretability, several evaluation metrics are dynamically suggested to the user, and uncertain clustering assignments are visualized as well. This helps the end user develop a much better understanding of the clusters being generated.

**Discussion points:**

 - Q1: Decisive feature selection often plays an important role in unsupervised learning but here the users of clustrophile seemed to prefer a more qualitative approach by identifying relevant features and correlations from the distribution heatmap.

 - Q2: I would have liked to know a bit more details and information about how the workings of the "help me decide" panel.
