**Summary:**

 - LL: Bug tracking helps automates the process of monitoring and tracking issues that may hamper the performance of a software product & build lifecycles.

 - LL: "Bad things happen when you don’t reuse code" - Code reusability helps to save time and reduce redundancy by reusing flows & procedures that have already been created earlier during the development process.

 - LL: "If you’re a programmer, and only some of your colleagues use the bug database, just start assigning them bugs in the database. Eventually they’ll get the hint." It is a good practice for the entire development team to use bug tracking & this is a good idea to nudge them gently in that direction.  

**Discussion points:**

 - Q1: Nowadays with Continous Integration / Continuous Delivery tools already integrated into many version control systems, it should also become imperative to include integration with automated bug tracking to see if the requested build has addressed pending bugs or not. 

 - Q2: How about letting users of the product have ability to add bugs to the database ?
