**Summary:**

 - LL: The author believes that it is equally important to represent error and uncertainty in both 2D and 3D visualizations. 

 - LL: An enjoyable HCI experience is (and continues to be) a key for both visualization and computer graphics. More often than not, making a scientific viz tool more accessable through effective interaction tends to make it a popular choice among users. 

 - LL: The usage of multifield or multi variable visualization - for ex. computational science and engineering simulations involving a combination of a number of scalar, vector or tensor fields, is something that slowly growing in popularity & will be useful to visualize interactions between these fields.

**Discussion points:**

 - Q1: Could we say that Interactive visual computing (coming from a 2004 paper) is just another term for Augmented or Virtual Reality? In terms of exploration and visualization in 3D environment?

 - Q2: When we talk about multifield visualization, especially in big data where the number of correlated fields / dimensions are super high, is it suitable to use dimensionality reduction algorithms here or would it be better to just drop less important dimensions?
